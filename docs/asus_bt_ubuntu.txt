Perfect — the ASUS USB-BT500 (Realtek RTL8761B) can work very well on Ubuntu Desktop, but it often needs firmware files and sometimes a newer kernel Bluetooth driver depending on your Ubuntu version.

Below is the definitive installation guide for Ubuntu (22.04, 24.04, or similar).

1. Check your Ubuntu version
First, see what you’re running:

lsb_release -a

If you’re on Ubuntu 22.04 or 24.04, the driver support is mostly built-in — you just need the firmware package.

2. Plug in the ASUS USB-BT500
Then check if the system detects it:

lsusb

You should see something like:

Bus 001 Device 006: ID 0b05:190e ASUSTek Computer, Inc. Broadcom Bluetooth 5.0 Adapter

If you see that → it’s recognized as a USB device.
Now check kernel messages:

dmesg | grep -i bluetooth

If you see a message like:

Bluetooth: hci0: RTL: firmware file not found
Bluetooth: hci0: RTL: rtl: loading rtl_bt/rtl8761b_fw.bin failed

you need to install the firmware manually (next step).

3. Install firmware
Try the official Realtek firmware package first:

sudo apt update
sudo apt install firmware-realtek -y

Then reboot:

sudo reboot

After reboot, check again:

dmesg | grep -i hci

You should now see:

Bluetooth: hci0: RTL: firmware version 0xxxxxxx
Bluetooth: hci0: RTL: rtl: firmware loaded successfully

If that doesn’t appear, continue below.


4. (Manual method) Install Realtek RTL8761B firmware manually
If firmware-realtek didn’t include the correct files (some Ubuntu releases don’t ship them yet):

cd /lib/firmware/rtl_bt
sudo wget https://github.com/winterheart/broadcom-bt-firmware/raw/master/rtl_bt/rtl8761b_fw.bin
sudo wget https://github.com/winterheart/broadcom-bt-firmware/raw/master/rtl_bt/rtl8761b_config.bin
sudo reboot

After reboot:

dmesg | grep -i hci

You should see confirmation that firmware loaded successfully.

5. Check Bluetooth interface

hciconfig -a

You should see something like:

hci0: Type: Primary  Bus: USB
        BD Address: 00:1A:7D:DA:71:13  ACL MTU: 1021:8  SCO MTU: 64:1
        UP RUNNING PSCAN
        ...

If it’s DOWN:

sudo hciconfig hci0 up

6. Enable and test Bluetooth service
Ensure the Bluetooth service is active:

sudo systemctl enable bluetooth
sudo systemctl start bluetooth
systemctl status bluetooth

Then use the interactive tool:

bluetoothctl

Inside:

power on
scan on

You should see nearby devices appear.

7. (Optional) Install GUI Bluetooth tools
For Ubuntu Desktop:

sudo apt install blueman -y

You’ll get a Bluetooth icon in your system tray for easy pairing and management.


8. Verify persistence
Reboot once more to ensure it initializes automatically:

sudo reboot

After restart, run:

hciconfig

If you still see hci0 → everything is permanent and working fine.

Summary

What this does:

Loads the correct Realtek RTL8761B firmware

Enables the Bluetooth service

Makes your ASUS USB-BT500 usable on Ubuntu
